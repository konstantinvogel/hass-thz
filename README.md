This is a custom component to connect a Stiebel Eltron LWZ or Tecalor THZ Heat Pump to Homeassistant.
Connection is made either with USB or ser.net

It is based on the respective FHEM-Module by Immi.

I neither claim that it will work nor that it's safe to use but until now my heatpump didn't explode.

Feel free to try it out and give me feedback.

Right now the basic readings and settings are implemented, the rest will follow soon.
