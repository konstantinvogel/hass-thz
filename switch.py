    Represents a switch entity for a THZ device in Home Assistant.
    This class provides asynchronous methods to control and monitor a switch on a THZ device.
    It handles reading the switch state from the device, as well as turning the switch on and off
    by sending the appropriate commands. Thread safety is ensured by acquiring a lock on the device
    during communication operations.
    Attributes:
        _attr_should_poll (bool): Indicates if the entity should be polled for updates.
        _attr_name (str): The name of the switch entity.
        _command (str): The command code used to communicate with the device.
        _device: The device instance used for communication.
        _attr_icon (str): The icon representing the switch in the UI.
        _attr_unique_id (str): A unique identifier for the switch entity.
        _is_on (bool): The current state of the switch (on/off).
        name (str): The name of the switch.
        command (str): The command code for the switch.
        min_value (int): Minimum value for the switch (unused in this implementation).
        max_value (int): Maximum value for the switch (unused in this implementation).
        step (int): Step value for the switch (unused in this implementation).
        unit (str): Unit of measurement (unused in this implementation).
        device_class (str): Device class for the switch (unused in this implementation).
        device: The device instance for communication.
        icon (str, optional): Icon for the switch. Defaults to "mdi:eye".
        unique_id (str, optional): Unique identifier for the switch.
    Properties:
        is_on (bool): Returns the current state of the switch.
    Methods:
        async_update(): Asynchronously updates the state of the switch by reading its value from the device.
